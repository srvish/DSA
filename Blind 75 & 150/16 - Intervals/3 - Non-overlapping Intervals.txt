Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note: Intervals are non-overlapping even if they have a common point. For example, [1, 3] and [2, 4] are overlapping, but [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,4],[1,4]]

Output: 1

Explanation: After [1,4] is removed, the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,4]]

Output: 0

Constraints:

    1 <= intervals.length <= 1000
    intervals[i].length == 2
    -50000 <= starti < endi <= 50000

Solution:
public class Solution {
    public int EraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        Array.Sort(intervals, (i, j) => i[0] - j[0]);
        int prevEnd = intervals[0][1];
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.Length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < prevEnd) {
                res++;
                prevEnd = Math.Min(intervals[i][1], prevEnd);
            } else {
                prevEnd = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
