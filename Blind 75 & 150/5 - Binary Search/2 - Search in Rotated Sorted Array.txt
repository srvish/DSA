You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending order. It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:
    [3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
    [1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.
Given the rotated sorted array nums and an integer target, return the index of target within nums, or -1 if it is not present.
You may assume all elements in the sorted rotated array nums are unique,
A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,1,2], target = 1
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,5,6,0,1,2], target = 4
Output: -1

Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 1000
    -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
    -1000 <= target <= 1000
    All values of nums are unique.
    nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.

Solution:
public class Solution {
    public int Search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int res = int.MinValue;
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.Length - 1;

        while (l < r) {
            int mid = (l + r) / 2;
            if (nums[r] < nums[mid]) {
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid;
            }
        }
        int pivot = l;
        res = Math.Max(res, GetIndex(nums, 0, pivot - 1, target));
        res = Math.Max(res, GetIndex(nums, pivot, nums.Length - 1, target));

        return res;
    }

    public int GetIndex(int[] nums, int i, int j, int target) {
        while(i <= j) {
            int mid = (i + j) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] < target) {
                i = mid + 1;
            } else if (nums[mid] > target) {
                j = mid - 1;
            } else {
                return mid;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
