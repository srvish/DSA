Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

    For example, "cat" is a subsequence of "crabt".

Example 1:

Input: nums = [9,1,4,2,3,3,7]

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [1,2,3,7], which has a length of 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,1,3,2,3]

Output: 4

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 1000
    -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

Solution:
public class Solution {
    public int LengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int max = 0;
        int[] dp = new int[nums.Length];
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++)
            {
                if(nums[i] > nums[j] && dp[i] < dp[j] + 1)
                {
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + 1;
                    max = Math.Max(max, dp[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return max + 1;
    }
}
