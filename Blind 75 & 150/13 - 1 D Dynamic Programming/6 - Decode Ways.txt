A string consisting of uppercase english characters can be encoded to a number using the following mapping:

'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"

To decode a message, digits must be grouped and then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above. There may be multiple ways to decode a message. For example, "1012" can be mapped into:

    "JAB" with the grouping (10 1 2)
    "JL" with the grouping (10 12)

The grouping (1 01 2) is invalid because 01 cannot be mapped into a letter since it contains a leading zero.

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. You can assume that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:

Input: s = "12"

Output: 2

Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

Example 2:

Input: s = "01"

Output: 0

Explanation: "01" cannot be decoded because "01" cannot be mapped into a letter.

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 100
    s consists of digits

Solution:
public class Solution {
    public int NumDecodings(string s) {
        int a = 1;
        int b = 0;

        for(int i = s.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int temp;
            if (s[i] == '0') {
                temp = 0;
            } else {
                temp = a;
                if (i + 1 < s.Length && (s[i] == '1' || (s[i] == '2' && s[i + 1] < '7'))) {
                    temp += b;
                }
            }
            (a, b) = (temp, a);
        }

        return a;
    }
}
