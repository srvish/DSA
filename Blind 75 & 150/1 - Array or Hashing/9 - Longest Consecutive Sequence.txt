Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.
A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element. The elements do not have to be consecutive in the original array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,20,4,10,3,4,5]
Output: 4

Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [2, 3, 4, 5].
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,2,5,4,6,1,1]
Output: 7

Constraints:
    0 <= nums.length <= 1000
    -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Solution:

public class Solution {
    public int LongestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        HashSet<int> hs = new HashSet<int>(nums);
        int max = 0;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++) {
            max = 1;
            if (!hs.Contains(nums[i] - 1)) {
                int val = nums[i] + 1;
                while(hs.Contains(val)) {
                    max++;
                    val++;
                }
            }
            res = Math.Max(max, res);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
