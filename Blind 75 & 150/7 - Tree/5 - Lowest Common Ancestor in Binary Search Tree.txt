Given a binary search tree (BST) where all node values are unique, and two nodes from the tree p and q, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.
The lowest common ancestor between two nodes p and q is the lowest node in a tree T such that both p and q as descendants. The ancestor is allowed to be a descendant of itself.

Example 1:
Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = 3, q = 8
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = 3, q = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 3 and 4 is 3, since a node can be a descendant of itself.

Constraints:
    2 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 100.
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100
    p != q
    p and q will both exist in the BST.

Solution:
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     public int val;
 *     public TreeNode left;
 *     public TreeNode right;
 *     public TreeNode(int val=0, TreeNode left=null, TreeNode right=null) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */

public class Solution {
    public TreeNode LowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {

        TreeNode res = root;
        while(res != null) {
            if (res.val > p.val && res.val > q.val) {
                return LowestCommonAncestor(res.left, p, q);
            } else if (res.val < p.val && res.val < q.val) {
                return LowestCommonAncestor(res.right, p, q);
            } else {
                return res;
            }
        }

        return null;
    }
}
