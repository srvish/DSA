Given the root of a non-empty binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes has an edge connecting them. A node can not appear in the sequence more than once. The path does not necessarily need to include the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]

Output: 6

Explanation: The path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

Example 2:
Input: root = [-15,10,20,null,null,15,5,-5]

Output: 40

Explanation: The path is 15 -> 20 -> 5 with a sum of 15 + 20 + 5 = 40.

Constraints:

    1 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 1000.
    -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

Solution:
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     public int val;
 *     public TreeNode left;
 *     public TreeNode right;
 *     public TreeNode(int val=0, TreeNode left=null, TreeNode right=null) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */

public class Solution {
    int max = int.MinValue;

    public int MaxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        int res = DFS(root);
        return Math.Max(max, res);
    }

    public int DFS(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        int left = Math.Max(DFS(root.left), 0);
        int right = Math.Max(DFS(root.right), 0);
        
        max = Math.Max(max, root.val + left + right);
        return root.val + Math.Max(left, right);
    }
