Given a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains an integer value and a list of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

The graph is shown in the test cases as an adjacency list. An adjacency list is a mapping of nodes to lists, used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

For simplicity, nodes values are numbered from 1 to n, where n is the total number of nodes in the graph. The index of each node within the adjacency list is the same as the node's value (1-indexed).

The input node will always be the first node in the graph and have 1 as the value.

Example 1:
Input: adjList = [[2],[1,3],[2]]

Output: [[2],[1,3],[2]]

Explanation: There are 3 nodes in the graph.
Node 1: val = 1 and neighbors = [2].
Node 2: val = 2 and neighbors = [1, 3].
Node 3: val = 3 and neighbors = [2].

Example 2:
Input: adjList = [[]]

Output: [[]]

Explanation: The graph has one node with no neighbors.

Example 3:

Input: adjList = []

Output: []

Explanation: The graph is empty.

Constraints:

    0 <= The number of nodes in the graph <= 100.
    1 <= Node.val <= 100
    There are no duplicate edges and no self-loops in the graph.

Solution:
/*
// Definition for a Node.
public class Node {
    public int val;
    public IList<Node> neighbors;

    public Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = new List<Node>();
    }

    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = new List<Node>();
    }

    public Node(int _val, List<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
}
*/

public class Solution {
    public Node CloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return node;
        }
        Dictionary<int, Node> visited = new();
        return DFS(node, visited);
    }

    public Node DFS(Node node, Dictionary<int, Node> visited) {
        if (visited.ContainsKey(node.val)) {
            return visited[node.val];
        }
        var copy = new Node(node.val);
        visited[node.val] = copy;
        foreach(var child in node.neighbors) {
            var clone = DFS(child, visited);
            copy.neighbors.Add(clone);
        }

        return copy;
    }
}
